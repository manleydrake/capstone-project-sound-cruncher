flaskapp.py is the executable file
/DCASE will prompt user to select a file then submit
Will then redirect to /results which will be where we display results
File is saved in Images folder.
Tried changing name of Images to Sounds or somethign fitting, but kept getting errors and couldn't find where. Will work on fixing that.
Note: Does not check what kind of file is submitted yet. Any file submitted will be saved to Images folder
Also, when testing, I could only get one file at a time to be saved in Images and I'm not sure if that was just a visual glitch or if it is due to the code itself, will look into more. Quick fix is to delete file from folder after each test run.
